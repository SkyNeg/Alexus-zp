Once you have a backup of your content please let us know and we can continue with the migration. After the migration has been completed you will need to re-upload all content and recreate any databases and email accounts as well as pointing your domain nameservers to a new location.

Your old IP Address and hosting content will remain active for two weeks to avoid downtime due to the propagation of the new nameservers. After two weeks the content will be removed from the old control panel.

If you have Windows account and use ColdFusion please note that Coldfusion is not enabled on the new servers by default. You will have to enable this separately in Account Settings for extra cost $5/mo right after the move is completed. Coldfusion version will be upgraded to Coldfusion MX 7 (7.0.2.142559). We cannot proceed with platform switch if you do not agree with these conditions.

Please reply to this ticket once you are ready for us to perform the switch and we will be happy to proceed.
