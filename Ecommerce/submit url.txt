note that the "big 4" search engines (AOL, Google, MSN, Yahoo!) have stopped accepting automatic submissions, like our form. Instead, you may want to visit each of these search engines and submit your information directly. For instance, to submit data to Google, visit google.com, search for "add my website to google" and the first link should be Google's own page for search engine submission. There is no charge to do this, as many customers think.
