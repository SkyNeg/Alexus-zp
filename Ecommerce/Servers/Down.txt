I am really sorry for this recent inconvenience. All these issues have been caused by the  server's urgent unscheduled maintenance that is taking place at the moment. Our admins are  working hard to get this issue resolved as soon as possible but unfortunately we do not have  an estimated time frame on this up to the moment. After the works' completion your sites will  be back to their original state. We hope for your understanding and cooperation. Thanks in  advance.
