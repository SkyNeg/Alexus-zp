I am sorry, you have to change your FTP password from your FTP manager in control panel. Recently we have changed it to protect our costumers from hackers attack. Also we have sent notification e-mail to all costumers. Probably you have not received it yet, or have not read



At first, please tale our sincere apologies for the inconvenience you might have encountered due to FTP passwords change we applied. We were forced to perform this important step urgently because of dramatically increased amount of hacks all over the Internet.
This was done only for the purpose of preventing possible hacking of your account. As well, we have put strong requirements for password to not allow setting weak ftp passwords anymore.
I need to draw your attention that ftp passwords change was just one of several security measures we performed to help protect customer's accounts from hackers. For example, we upgraded Apache and ProFTPd versions, installed mod_security on all our servers to eliminate XSS attacks. We appreciate your patience and understanding in this situation as we doing our best to provide the highest level of web hosting services. Thank you for cooperation.
