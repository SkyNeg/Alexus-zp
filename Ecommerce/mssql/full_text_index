Hello,

First of all let me pleas inform you, that full text indexing is enabled on all our servers. To set full text indexing for the direct table and field we need to make your request clear, please provide us with the following information:
1. databasename - vishwai_JobDB
2. tablename - fld_recrequirement
3. fields to search: fld_jobname
4. extra fields you may need:
unique key
Also you should be able to use this functionality on your site. So please use sp_fulltext_database stored procedure, And then use other sp_fulltext_… stored procedures to manipulate indexes. Please refer to the following articles for more information:

Kind regards,
