Jay: Hi

you: Hello

Jay: How may I assist you ?

you: We have some troubles with trust logo

Jay: Order # ?

you: We use SSL from your reseller IXwebhosting

you: Does trusted logo require something else except SSL order?

Jay: Can I have the SSL order # or the domain name, which will help us to assist you better.

you: sure, here is domain name tefacturo.com

Jay: What is the issue you are facing now ?

you: When we try to install trustlogo from http://www.trustlogo.com/ssl-certificate-support/ we receive error in pop-up with message that idAuthority Credentials NOT available for this site

Jay: We are not offering the Trust Logo for an Essential SSL certificate, so IDAuthority credentials can't be displayed.

Jay: If you want to display the Trust Logo with IDAuthority credentials, then you need to buy an Instant SSL certificate.

you: Ok, understand, Thank you
