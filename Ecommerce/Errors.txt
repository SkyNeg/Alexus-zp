The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
he server encountered an error. Usually such error messages show up with CGI scripts. Also you can get such an error message when you have bad syntax in your .htaccess file.
Also you have to check all permissions in cgi-bin folder it should be 755.
In some cases the error connect with server problems. (notice by me once)
