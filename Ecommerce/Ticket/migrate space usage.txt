First of all let me reassure you there is nothing to worry about. You have received this message because you are among the 1% of our top disk space users. Among the accounts using a large amount of disk space we have found several with copyright and other illegal material and others that are used for off-site storage which violates our terms of service. Because of this, we chose to inform all customers above a certain disk space limit of the upcoming detailed audit that will occur during the next few days. The owners of the accounts that violate our terms of service will be informed individually, but we wanted to give everyone who might have such files the opportunity to remove them. 

I would like to apologize if this message caused any inconvenience to you. We offer and guarantee unlimited storage and bandwidth for all sites that comply with our terms of service, however, if one customer is using more than 10% of the total disk space of one server, we have to take action to ensure reliable and stable service to all customers on this particular server. As a result, your account may be moved to a brand new server, especially built for high disk usage and performance. By doing that we will be able to serve your as well as all our other customer's needs. In case all the files in your account are legitimate and your account is selected to be moved to a new server, we will perform the complete migration for you with no downtime whatsoever. We will open a new ticket to update you when this move occurs.
