I am sorry for any possible inconveniences and misunderstandings from our side, but please let me explain the situation. The price for the upgrade of your account to Basic Plan plan is $142.80 for two years, while the signing price for the account with the same hosting plan and billing period is $94.80. It is a promotional price, and is proposed as sort of discount initially and only once with signup. I regret but promotional price can be given only with signup of new hosting plan
