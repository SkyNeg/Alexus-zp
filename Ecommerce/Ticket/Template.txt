	There is no backups for this account
I regret to inform you that our administrators have checked the issue from our side and found that there are no available backups of your account currently on the server. We do make regular backup of customer's data but it happens sometime that backups are rotated because we cannot afford to store too old backups due to the many system restrictions of the shared hosting environment, and there is no other backup of your account at the moment. That is why it is much recommended to create local backups of your data by yourself. Thank you for understanding and cooperation.

I am sorry, but we do not provide sftp at all. So you are not able to use it. I regret.
To restore your login e-mail and password we need to confirm some information from you. Could you provide it to us:
1. last 6 digits of your active CC on account;
2. CC type;
3. CC expiry date;
4. full CC holder's name.

Once you provide this information, we'll give you your correct login data.
Wrong DNS 
I have checked your domain and found that you use not our name servers. You could check it from this link: http://who.is/whois-com/ip-address/endlesswishing.com/ Current name servers are:
    dns1.name-services.com
    dns2.name-services.com
    dns3.name-services.com
    dns4.name-services.com
    dns5.name-services.com 
To be able use our mail service you should have our name servers for your domain. That is why you have to go to your registrar (ENOM, INC. ) and change name servers to: ns7.ixwebhosting.com and ns8.ixwebhosting.com
After DNS propagation (it could take up to 72 hours) your mail will work properly.
Pop before SMTP

The situation that you have presented is a common occurrence. We use on our mail servers, a method of outgoing mail authentication called pop before SMTP.
Pop before SMTP does simply what its name states. It requires that you log into your incoming mail server to be able to send email. When your email client logs into your incoming mail server, it then logs your IP address in a temporary (5 minute) cache of IPs that are able to send email through our mail servers. During this period you may send email freely.
Some newer email clients are designed to handle this form of authentication. If however your email client of choice does not support this method by default, you can simply set your email client to check for new mail every one or two minutes. This method will allow for a constant white list of your IP address. 
So you could set in your mail software settings: Login into POP server before sending e-mails, or click receive e-mails before sending.
	Virtual FTP
Please note that since you have enabled virtual FTP for your domain (FTP Services at control panel), it will reject master FTP login and password as well as FTP subaccounts logins and passwords. If you need to login with master FTP login/password or with FTP subaccount login/password, please use FTP host name 'webXX.ixwebhosting.com'

		Yahoo e-mail
Yahoo has set Throttle policy to accept certain amount of messages from outside servers per certain time limit, so there is nothing we can do more but wait.
If you are sending to mail servers different than Yahoo's you can consider issue resolved. We have taken all possible preventive measures to avoid such things from happening in future, and hope it will not reoccur.
We thank you for your great patience and all understanding

		mysql migration
We are very sorry to see our client upset, but let me explain current situation. As you know our company provides shared service for our customers. This implies that all system resources are shared between customer` accounts assigned to the same server. I regret but unfortunately we should confirm that your server is unstable currently. This distressing situation is caused by the fact that an account or several accounts on your server are using such amount recourses of the server that it is causing unstable performance of other accounts shared the server with them. In other words those accounts are overloaders. In current moment we make all our efforts for catching those overloaders. Unfortunately their service can’t be disabled immediately as it requires certain procedures. Our system administrators are working on your server with the highest priority, so the balance of the resources on the server will be restored in the nearest time.
However, I'll send this ticket to our system administrators' department in order to check if we have any possibilities to move your databases to the less loaded mysql server right now.
Please accept our sincere apologies once again. We understand that your business in our hands and we are doing our best to make your messages to our Help Desk with positive content only.

I honestly apologize for inconveniences caused to you. Our system administration team is working on this issue. It will be resolved as soon as possible.


As with any DNS modification you'll need to wait at least 72 hours for this change to completely take effect worldwide.Dear Kirk 

I have checked your domain and found that current problem was related to corrupted php5-cgi-fcgi.ini file, which is used as php.ini for your domain. I have renamed old file to php5-cgi-fcgi.ini_ and created fresh php5-cgi-fcgi.ini file under your domain folder. Now your site works fine and you can change php.ini settings in new php5-cgi-fcgi.ini file under your domain directory. Please re-check it from your side
