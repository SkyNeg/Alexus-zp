Procedure

If you are dealing with an outdated software issue (such as phpBB, Joomla!, WordPress, etc), please follow these steps Outdated Software Procedure

SA Steps

   1.
      Perform any steps necessary to prevent a customer from continuing to abuse our services. Use your own judgment and the steps needed will depend on the type of abuse. Consult a higher level SA that is online if you have any questions. Examples:
          *
            Server is low on disk space ? Delete any copyrighted content to free up space.
          *
            Server is overloaded by network traffic ? Add rules to /firewall/firewall.local to block the traffic.
          *
            Server is overloaded by a website/program ? Kill the processes and chmod the customer's directory.
   2.
      Locate the customer's account using GHCP.
   3.
      Click on the Create Ticket link.
   4.
      Fill in the ticket subject and description with an appropriate template from the list below.
   5.
      Put any relevant info into the notes section. You MUST include details on what you did during Step 1.
   6.
      Set the ticket as Technical, On Hold and to ToS1).

CR Steps

   1.
      Update the customer notes. It is the responsibility of the first CR that picks up the ticket to update the Customer Notes area. The Customer Notes should have: ticket number, type of infraction, the number of the violation.
   2.
      Place a call to the customer, to explain the violation and how to resolve the issue. Please make sure you are calling between 8am - 8pm the customer's time zone.
          *
            If the violation is in regards to an overload and we have removed permissions to the database or firewalled the domain, there is no need to call. Set the ticket to waiting. It will be up to the customer to contact us to resolve this matter.
          *
            When dealing with Spam TOS violations check the message to see if it meets the four government requirements found here. If it meets these requirements, the message is not Spam.
                o
                  The email's “From,” “To,” and routing information – including the originating domain name and email address – must be accurate and identify the person who initiated the email.
                o
                  The subject line cannot mislead the recipient about the contents or subject matter of the message.
                o
                  You must provide a return email address or another Internet-based response mechanism (like an unsubscribe link) that allows a recipient to ask you not to send future email messages to that email address, and you must honor the requests. Please note that having an unsubscribe link is not enough, the unsubscribe requests must be honored.
                o
                  Commercial email must be identified as an advertisement and include the sender's valid physical postal address. Your message must contain clear and conspicuous notice that the message is an advertisement or solicitation and that the recipient can opt out of receiving more commercial email from you. It also must include your valid physical postal address.
   3.
      Make sure to modify the time period remaining for them to respond when updating the template by subtracting the time period customer has left to take action on the TOS issue. If the customer has made arrangements or has requested an extension please note this in the ticket notes if the time period has been extended.
   4.
      Update the ticket with any necessary notes. It is also helpful to have in the ticket notes area if there is more than one TOS on a customer account to place all the ticket numbers, dates and violations. This will help us out to be able to then monitor if there is a pattern or maybe further investigation needs to be done into customer account to see if there is a shell script if pertaining to phishing.
          *
            For all other issues, we have attempted to contact the customer for 3 days. If we cannot get in contact with him and the violation is not an overload, suspend the account and set the ticket to waiting. It will be up to the customer to contact us to resolve this matter..
          *
            If the customer has violated the terms of service twice add the following to your ticket update:

“Please note that this is the second time within 12 months you have violated our TOS. Unfortunately, we have to bring this to your attention that as per our Terms of Service a third instance may result in immediate account termination without notice. If this occurs, no backups will be provided. If you have any questions about how to avoid this from happening again our support team will be glad to advise.”
Three Strikes and You Are Out

In the event a customer’s account receives three complaints of the same nature the account may be suspended after evaluation by two members of Ecommerce Executive Management. In some cases, especially with phishing, it is in our best interests to work with the customer to keep it from repeating instead of permanently suspending the customer. After evaluating, if the managers decide to permanently suspend, a manager should update the modify notes with the reason for suspension “persistent tos violator” and possibly update these notes with the violation ticket numbers. The following template should be sent to the customer by the manager or the representative handling the ticket:
Account Suspension- TOS Violations

Refund for 3rd Time ToS

We cannot refund any money to people who violate our Terms of Service three times. According to our ToS:

B. Any-Time Money Back Guarantee IX Web Hosting proudly offers its subscribers an “Any-Time Money Back Guarantee.” This guarantee allows subscriber to use IX Web Hosting's services with full confidence and zero-risk. Consequently, subscriber may request a full refund of the current month's fees (not the current billing cycle) and to-date pre-paid fees for future months, less any additional over-usage, setup fees and free domain registration costs (see section I.C below). Terminated accounts are not eligible for this guarantee if the termination occurred due to a violation of this TOS.

Also, another facet of our ToS says the following:

XV. Suspension of Service or Cancellation IX Web Hosting reserves the right to suspend network access to any subscriber if in the judgment of IX Web Hosting, the subscriber's account is the source or target of a violation of any of the terms of the TOS, or for any other reason which IX Web Hosting deems necessary. If inappropriate or illegal activity is detected or brought to our attention by a third party, all accounts of the subscriber in question will be deactivated until our investigation is complete. Multiple violations of the TOS will result in permanent cancellation of the account without refund of any fee. Prior notification to the subscriber is not assured. In extreme cases, law enforcement will be contacted regarding the activity. The subscriber may not be credited for the time the subscriber's machines were suspended if the subscriber is found to be at fault. The subscriber is also responsible for maintaining a backup of his current data at all times. Upon the third violation of the terms of service no backups will be provided.

Spam

Hello (Name),

We have been notified of a complaint regarding “spam” generated from an e-mail address on your account. In most cases, our customers do not intend to send spam. When we receive these complaints, it is important that we investigate the claim, and then ensure that you know the guidelines for what qualifies a commercial e-mail as spam. We require a response giving us your assurance that you will not send any Spam from your account in the future.

To make sure that your e-mail does not qualify as spam, please view the governmental guidelines here:

http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/ecommerce/bus61.shtm

Please understand that we must maintain a strict policy against spam, and your cooperation protects not only you and your account, but all of the mail accounts hosted on your mail server, from becoming blacklisted. In a shared hosting environment, if a mail server becomes blacklisted, all of the customers using that server would be blocked from sending mail, as any email exiting from a given server would then be considered potential spam by the blacklisting entity.

If you determine that you did not send this mail, please change all of your e-mail and control panel passwords. You will also want to scan your local computer(s) with an updated virus filtering software (such as AVG or Avast - both are free downloads) and check the security of the network that most of your mail originates from. You may also want to check your website's files and code for potential security vulnerabilities.

Please respond to this ticket letting us know of your intention to stop sending any spam, whether it is intentional or not. We will require you to agree to our request for compliance within XX hours or your account will become suspended. We do not wish to suspend your entire account, so it will be important for you to respond to this message by logging into your control panel, and accessing this ticket via the 24/7 help desk, or provide this ticket number to our Live Chat or phone representative.

We appreciate your cooperation in this matter and thank you for your time.

Phishing
1st and 2nd Violations

Hi (Name),

I am sorry to have to report this, but we have received notification of phishing material in your account. Usually, phishing files are placed through some sort of exploit either in outdated code or weak file or folder permissions. Shopping carts and photo galleries are common culprits as hackers find exploits that developers fix almost daily, so keeping all programs as up to date as possible is a necessity.

If you would, please remove this content and update any third-party software in your account that may need it. We would really like to work with you to get this solved because on your 3rd Terms of Service violation we would have to terminate your account.

As soon as possible, please reply to this ticket saying you agree to comply with the terms above and also let us know what actions you will be taking to solve this problem. You may either log into your control panel with us or access this ticket via the 24/7 help desk or either call in or chat with us and provide this ticket number to our Live Chat or phone representatives.

As mentioned above, please respond to this ticket within XX hours. If we do not hear from you within this time frame, we will have to suspend your account until this matter is resolved.
