SA Steps

   1.
      Perform any steps necessary to prevent a customer from continuing to abuse our services. Use your own judgment and the steps needed will depend on the type of abuse. Consult a higher level SA that is online if you have any questions. Examples:
          *
            Server is low on disk space ? Delete any copyrighted content to free up space.
          *
            Server is overloaded by network traffic ? Add rules to /firewall/firewall.local to block the traffic.
          *
            Server is overloaded by a website/program ? Kill the processes and chmod the customer's directory.
   2.
      Locate the customer's account using GHCP.
   3.
      Click on the Create Ticket link.
   4.
      Fill in the ticket subject and description with an appropriate template from the list below.
   5.
      Put any relevant info into the notes section. You MUST include details on what you did during Step 1.
   6.
      Set the ticket as Technical, On Hold and to ToS1).

CR Steps

   1.
      Update the customer notes. It is the responsibility of the first CR that picks up the ticket to update the Customer Notes area. The Customer Notes should have: ticket number, type of infraction, the number of the violation.
   2.
      Place a call to the customer, to explain the violation and how to resolve the issue. Please make sure you are calling between 8am - 8pm the customer's time zone.
          *
            If the violation is in regards to an overload and we have removed permissions to the database or firewalled the domain, there is no need to call. Set the ticket to waiting. It will be up to the customer to contact us to resolve this matter.
          *
            When dealing with Spam TOS violations check the message to see if it meets the four government requirements found here. If it meets these requirements, the message is not Spam.
                o
                  The email's “From,” “To,” and routing information – including the originating domain name and email address – must be accurate and identify the person who initiated the email.
                o
                  The subject line cannot mislead the recipient about the contents or subject matter of the message.
                o
                  You must provide a return email address or another Internet-based response mechanism (like an unsubscribe link) that allows a recipient to ask you not to send future email messages to that email address, and you must honor the requests. Please note that having an unsubscribe link is not enough, the unsubscribe requests must be honored.
                o
                  Commercial email must be identified as an advertisement and include the sender's valid physical postal address. Your message must contain clear and conspicuous notice that the message is an advertisement or solicitation and that the recipient can opt out of receiving more commercial email from you. It also must include your valid physical postal address.
   3.
      Make sure to modify the time period remaining for them to respond when updating the template by subtracting the time period customer has left to take action on the TOS issue. If the customer has made arrangements or has requested an extension please note this in the ticket notes if the time period has been extended.
   4.
      Update the ticket with any necessary notes. It is also helpful to have in the ticket notes area if there is more than one TOS on a customer account to place all the ticket numbers, dates and violations. This will help us out to be able to then monitor if there is a pattern or maybe further investigation needs to be done into customer account to see if there is a shell script if pertaining to phishing.
          *
            For all other issues, we have attempted to contact the customer for 3 days. If we cannot get in contact with him and the violation is not an overload, suspend the account and set the ticket to waiting. It will be up to the customer to contact us to resolve this matter..
          *
            If the customer has violated the terms of service twice add the following to your ticket update:

“Please note that this is the second time within 12 months you have violated our TOS. Unfortunately, we have to bring this to your attention that as per our Terms of Service a third instance may result in immediate account termination without notice. If this occurs, no backups will be provided. If you have any questions about how to avoid this from happening again our support team will be glad to advise.”
Three Strikes and You Are Out

In the event a customer’s account receives three complaints of the same nature the account may be suspended after evaluation by two members of Ecommerce Executive Management. In some cases, especially with phishing, it is in our best interests to work with the customer to keep it from repeating instead of permanently suspending the customer. After evaluating, if the managers decide to permanently suspend, a manager should update the modify notes with the reason for suspension “persistent tos violator” and possibly update these notes with the violation ticket numbers. The following template should be sent to the customer by the manager or the representative handling the ticket:
Account Suspension- TOS Violations

As per our records your account has violated our terms of service three times already. We have been trying to work with you to permanently resolve the situation, but unfortunately the actions taken were not persistent. Due to security reasons and our obligation to provide stable services towards other customers hosted on the same server, we regret to inform you that we cannot reenable your account. We will be unable to provide you with a back up of any content on our servers. If you have any further questions regarding this issue or our hosting services in general, please do not hesitate let us know.

Spam

We have been notified of an e-mail spam complaint generated from an e-mail address on your account. In most cases, our customers do not intend to send spam. When we receive these complaints, it is important that we investigate the claim, and then ensure that you know the guidelines for what makes a commercial e-mail qualify as spam, and receive your assurance that you will not send any Spam from your account.

If you determine that you did not send this mail, please change all of your e-mail and control panel passwords. You will also want to scan your local computer(s) with an updated virus filtering software (like AVG or Avast) and check the security of the network that most of your mail originates from.
