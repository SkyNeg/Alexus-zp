Unfortunately there's no possibility to perform server-side virus scanning since we provide shared hosting. The recommended solution for you is to download the site data and scan it locally on your PC. The web server is resistant to outside threads. Usually when we recieve reports that a website has been infected by a virus it is because the customer has outdated software running on the site and has not patched known security holes. It is strongly recommended to review everything that you have in website folder and check web server logs to determine the way you may protect your application against further intrusions.
