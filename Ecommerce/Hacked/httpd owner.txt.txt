Our PHP works as apache module. And httpd is apache user. So all files and folders that were created or changed by apache would have httpd as owner. To restore your default owner you should enter your control panel->FTP service->Enable FTP for one of your domain (if you have all turned off)->click edit button and add virtual ftp directory where you have wrong owner for your files. For example yourdomain.com/ After this you will be able to change or delete this files.
